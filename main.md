# HomeRack
## Current Setup Thoughts
6-8U rack for expandability. I think a 10-inch rack makes the most sense for me for now. I can 3D print the front panels for the Pis and probaby buy a 1U unit for the mini-ITX.
### 1/24/2025 
Currently in the planning stages. Things that I definitely want to store:
- 2x Raspberry Pis (1 Pi 4(?), 1 Pi 5) for my HomeAssistant and PiHole
- 1x Le Potato for OctoPi
- 1x mini-ITX computer with 6 (?) hard drives NAS
- 1x 1Gb PoE network switch
- 1x Power Hub / Power management

Height-wise, I would probably need:
- 2U for the 3 Pi-adjacent devices
- 1U for the mini-ITX?
- 1U for the PoE Network switch
- 1U for the power hub?

Which totals to 5U, so I could do 6U or ideally 8U for more expandability in the future.
